##  Sample Lotus application

This is a microposting app, similar to Tumblr.  Users can write posts, and follow other users.

This app is going to be a port of the Rails application from the Rails Tutorial.  (https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_rails_4) It should clearly demonstrate the architectural differences between Lotus and Rails.
